# Create a variable called secret_num and set it to any number you'd like:
secret_num = 120

# Increase secret_num by 1
secret_num = secret_num + 1

# Next, take the new number and double it
secret_num *= 2  # 242

# Next, take the new number and add four to it
secret_num += 4  # 246

# Next, take the new number and divide by two
secret_num /= 2  # 123

# Next, take the new number and subtract your original secret number from it
result = secret_num-120

# Print the final result
print('result: ', result)
